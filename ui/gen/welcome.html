Assets are divided into several categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Infantry</strong> - Infantry units with various roles, with preconfigured loadouts. A few infantry units have special abilities; for example, the repair specialist can repair vehicles and the diver can operate underwater. For a higher price, you may buy a Customized Unit, which is a special unit geared with your customized loadout, can repair vehicles, and has a higher accuracy.</li><li><strong>Light Vehicles</strong> - Light vehicles that are fast and cheap, mostly useful for transports, specialized purposes, or early game.</li><li><strong>Heavy Vehicles</strong> - Heavily armored vehicles from APCs to main battle tanks and artillery.</li><li><strong>Rotary Wing</strong> - Helicopters, ranging from transport and recon to high end attack helicopters, most useful in the early to mid-game.</li><li><strong>Fixed Wing</strong> - Fixed wing aircraft, ranging from light attack aircraft to air superiority jets.</li><li><strong>Remote Control</strong> - Remote control drone assets, useful for reconnaissance and light attack roles.</li><li><strong>Air Defense</strong> - Air defense assets, including static and mobile anti-air systems.</li><li><strong>Sector Defense</strong> - Mostly static sector defense assets, including turrets, the static AT launcher, and mortars.</li><li><strong>Structures</strong> - Static structures that can be placed in sectors, such as sandbags, bunkers, and towers.</li><li><strong>Naval</strong> - Naval assets, including boats, useful for coastal operations.</li><li><strong>Gear</strong> - Gear and equipment options that come in boxes and crates.</li><li><strong>Fast Travel</strong> - Fast travel and forward base options that allow players to quickly move to the frontline.</li><li><strong>Strategy</strong> - Strategy options that include sector scan, cruise missile strike, and other strategic actions.</li></ul></div><div class="panel right-panel category-gameplay" id="money"><h2>Money</h2><p>Players can earn money through various means:</p><ul><li><strong>Destroying enemy assets</strong> - Destroying enemy assets yields the most significant monetary rewards, depending on the asset's value. This is by far the easiest way to fill your account.</li><li><strong>Killing enemies</strong> - Player kills generate more money than AI kills.</li><li><strong>Capturing sectors</strong> - Actively capturing sectors rewards money, depending on the value of your contribution to the sector capture. Heavy tanks that have higher capture values will generate higher monetary rewards.</li><li><strong>Reconnaissance</strong> - Spotting enemies with tactical ping. Spotting enemies with recon optics is a quick way to get a lot of money.</li><li><strong>Special support actions</strong> - Support actions like reviving teammates, depleting enemy APS, or placing spawn vehicles.</li><li><strong>Passive income from controlled sectors</strong> - Players can earn a steady income from sectors they control. This is the slowest way to earn money.</li></ul><p>In general, the fastest way to earn money is to actively participate in the battle by destroying enemy assets and capturing objectives. In this game mode, it is highly recommended to do so with vehicles instead of on-foot. Instead of saving up a long time for big purchases, it is often much, much faster to buy and contribute to the team in lower-tier vehicles and use them as stepping stones to higher-tier assets.</p></div><div class="panel right-panel category-gameplay" id="loadouts"><h2>Loadouts</h2><p>Work in progress</p></div><div class="panel right-panel category-gameplay" id="aps"><h2>Active Protection System</h2><p>Active protection systems (APS) are defensive systems that are installed on armored vehicles to protect them from incoming projectiles. They work by intercepting and destroying incoming threats before they can hit the vehicle.</p><h3>APS types</h3><p>APS are available on most heavy vehicles and some light vehicles. There are four types of APS:</p><ul><li><strong>Light APS</strong> - Can intercept lighter hand-held rocket launchers. It is available on a few light vehicles. Comes with 2 ammo.</li><li><strong>Medium APS</strong> - Can intercept rockets and missiles. It is available on most APCs. Comes with 4 ammo.</li><li><strong>Heavy APS</strong> - Can intercept rockets and missiles. It is available on main battle tanks. Comes with 6 ammo.</li><li><strong>Dazzler</strong> - Can intercept guided munitions. It is available on select electronic warfare vehicles. Comes with 25 ammo.</li></ul><h3>Ammo consumption</h3><p>APS is consumed when it successfully intercepts a projectile. Once the APS ammo is depleted, the vehicle must be reloaded for the APS ammo to be replenished.</p><p>Some heavier munitions, especially air-to-ground munitions, may consume more than one APS ammo per interception.</p><p>With the vehicle menu, it is possible to see the current APS ammo count and reload the APS if needed.</p><h3>Engagement behavior</h3><p>APS will automatically engage incoming threats within a large radius and angle of attack. You should beware of triggering and depleting your team's APS before launching missiles and rockets near friendly vehicles.</p><p>When APS is triggered, the occupants of the vehicle are informed of the direction of the incoming vehicle, and any AI inside the vehicle will become instantly aware of the location of the threat.</p><p>Light, medium, and heavy APS all have a deadzone. Projectiles fired within ~30M of the vehicle will not be intercepted. This makes armored vehicles vulnerable to close-range attacks.</p><h3>Dazzlers</h3><p>Dazzlers can be toggled on/off. By default, it is off. Unlike other APS, dazzlers do not have a deadzone and can destroy incoming missiles even at very close range.</p><p>Dazzlers are generally ineffective against unguided munitions, such as unguided hand-held rocket launchers (like the RPG-7 and MAAWS), and aircraft bombs.</p><h3>Anti-ramming measures</h3><p>Vehicles with APS are partially protected from ramming vehicles. Armored vehicles are protected against the fuel explosions of other vehicles that are below its APS level. Additionally, infantry inside vehicles with at least medium APS are protected from direct ramming damage.</p></div><div class="panel right-panel category-gameplay" id="rearming"><h2>Rearming</h2><p>Vehicles can be rearmed using rearming crates and vehicles:</p><ul><li><strong>Vehicle Ammo</strong> - Cheapest option for rearming a single vehicle. Can be found in the Gear menu.</li><li><strong>Huron/Taru Ammo Containers</strong> - Can be slingloaded. Also found in the Gear menu.</li><li><strong>HEMMT/Tempest Ammo Trucks</strong> - Can be driven around. Found in the Light Vehicles menu.</li><li><strong>CRV-6e Bobcat</strong> - A Blufor-unique logistics vehicle that can rearm, repair, and refuel other vehicles.</li></ul><p>Rearming is done by driving the vehicle close to the rearming crate or vehicle and using the scroll wheel menu to find the Modify/Rearm. In this menu, you may modify the weapons loadout of the vehicle. If you have not consumed ammo (which includes APS and smoke), you can change the vehicle configuration without a cooldown timer.</p><p>This menu allows you to customize the vehicle's appearance (including camo and slat cages) and smoke seat. You may move the smoke launcher between the driver, gunner, and commander seats for easier access.</p><p>You can also remotely rearm vehicles using the Vehicles menu.</p><h3>Cooldown</h3><p>There is a cooldown for rearming vehicles. The cooldown depends on the vehicle. Here are the general guidelines for rearm timers:</p><ul><li>120 seconds: Light vehicles, dazzlers, boats</li><li>180 seconds: Medium vehicles, light AA/AT</li><li>240 seconds: Medium vehicles with specialized weapons, most AA, scout helicopters</li><li>300 seconds: Heavy vehicles, advanced AA, attack helicopters, light fixed wing</li><li>420 seconds: Heavy fixed wing</li><li>900 seconds: Mortars</li><li>1800 seconds: Heavy artillery</li></ul><p>You can see the rearm cooldown for the current vehicle you are using in the button right of your HUD.</p></div><div class="panel right-panel category-gameplay" id="air-and-defense"><h2>Air & Air Defense</h2><h3>Missile notching</h3><p>You can avoid getting hit in an aircraft by notching incoming missiles with effective maneuvering. The optimal flight path to notch missiles is perpendicular to the incoming missile, to go as low and as fast as possible, to break line of sight, and to utilize as many countermasures as possible. When notched, enemy missiles will show up as BLIND on your warning indicators, but they are still capable of damaging you for a short time after if you are near their flight path. Make sure to change directions after blinding enemy missiles.</p><h3>Air-to-air</h3><p>Air-to-air missiles are designed to engage enemy aircraft. They can be divided into two categories: short-range and medium/long-range missiles. Short-range IR-guided missiles are effective within 4 km. Longer range missiles are effective at range depending on your speed and altitude, as well as the target's speed and altitude.</p><h3>Suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)</h3><p>Destroy enemy air defenses to allow friendly aircraft to operate safely. Anti-radiation missiles can lock onto emitters, such as radars and SAM batteries, as well as any enemy vehicle that launched a missile at you. Make sure to select the right target in the SEAD menu, orient the aircraft to the angle of the target until the black circle turns red, and then fire.</p><h3>Lock on after launch (LOAL)</h3><p>Some anti-aircraft missiles can be launched without a direct lock. This is effective for engaging far targets. LOAL missiles are most effective when your aircraft is faster than 950 kph, with very long effective ranges if you climb above your target's altitude, the higher the better. Near the flight ceiling, LOAL missiles are extremely lethal at any range. Make sure to select the right target in the LOAL menu before launching.</p><h3>Bunker busters</h3><p>Bunker busters are remote-guided weapons that can be deployed from a safe distance, allowing aircraft to engage ground targets without entering heavily defended airspace. These bombs are guided by friendly players in your squad. Select the operator player and deploy the bomb. They will get the option to begin controlling the munition.</p><p>Bunker busters can do damage to strongholds and FOBs. They will destroy targets under buildings and hard cover. They can also be used manually as regular munition.</p><h3>GPS-guided bombs</h3><p>GPS-guided bombs can be used to engage targets with high precision from a safe distance. Enter the coordinates of the target, fly closer/higher until the range indicator turns green, and the bomb will guide itself to the target using GPS. Once at the coordinate, the bomb will seek and home on the highest value target near the grid square.</p><p>They can also be used manually as regular munition.</p><h3>ECM jammer</h3><p>Some aircraft have ECM jammers that can disrupt projectiles in flight. Aim the center of your screen at the incoming projectile, and the jammer will engage them. There is a limited charge and recharge timer for the jammer.</p><h3>Device jammer</h3><p>Attack helicopters have device jammers that can disrupt enemy dazzlers. Turn on the laser marker in the gunner seat, and it should turn off enemy dazzlers near where it is aimed.</p></div><div class="panel right-panel category-gameplay" id="relocating-assets"><h2>Asset relocation</h2><h3>Reset vehicle</h3><p>Almost all vehicles can be reset using the "Reset vehicle" option in the Buy Menu > Strategy. There is a 30 meter limit to how far the new vehicle position can be. This is the preferred way to reset flipped vehicles or turrets placed in undesirable locations.</p><p>Pitfall: sometimes resetting a vehicle into the same spot it is in can cause it to explode. To avoid, make sure to lock the vehicle position first, and wait a second before you finish the deployment process.</p><h3>Flatbed</h3><p>Flatbeds can be used to relocate smaller vehicles and turrets. They can be found in the Buy Menu > Light Vehicles. To relocate a vehicle, drive the flatbed close to the vehicle, and use the "Load deployable" option in the scroll wheel menu. The vehicle will be loaded onto the flatbed. You can then drive the flatbed to a new location and unload it using the "Unload deployable" option.</p><h3>Slingload</h3><p>Some vehicles can be slingloaded by helicopters. To do this, drive the vehicle close to the helicopter, and use the "Attach deployable" option in the scroll wheel menu. The helicopter will then pick up the vehicle and can fly it to a new location. You can then use the "Detach deployable" option to drop the vehicle at the new location.</p></div><div class="panel right-panel category-gameplay" id="fob"></div><div class="panel right-panel category-gameplay" id="strategies"></div></div></div><script>function generateLeftNav(){const e=document.querySelector(".left-panel ul"),t=document.querySelectorAll(".right-panel"),n=new Set;t.forEach(t=>{const o=t.id,c=t.querySelector("h2")?.textContent,a=Array.from(t.classList).find(e=>e.startsWith("category-"));if(a&&!n.has(a)){const t=a.replace("category-","").replace(/-/g," ").replace(/\b\w/g,e=>e.toUpperCase()),o=document.createElement("li");o.classList.add("category-item"),o.textContent=t,e.appendChild(o),n.add(a)}if(o&&c){const n=document.createElement("li"),a=document.createElement("a");a.href=`#${o}`,a.textContent=c,n.appendChild(a),e.appendChild(n),t.querySelectorAll("h3").forEach(t=>{const n=`${o}-${t.textContent.replace(/[()\/]/g,"").replace(/\s+/g,"-").toLowerCase()}`;t.id=n;const c=document.createElement("li");c.style.marginLeft="20px";const a=document.createElement("a");a.href=`#${n}`,a.textContent=t.textContent,c.appendChild(a),e.appendChild(c)})}})}document.addEventListener("mousedown",function(e){const t=e.target;if("A"===t.tagName&&t.closest(".left-panel")){e.preventDefault();const n=t.getAttribute("href"),o=decodeURIComponent(n.replace(/[()\/]/g,"").replace(/\s+/g,"-").toLowerCase()),c=document.querySelector(o);if(c&&"DIV"!==c.tagName){const e=c.closest(".right-panel");if(e){document.querySelectorAll(".right-panel").forEach(e=>e.style.display="none"),e.style.display="inline-block",c.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth",block:"start"});const t=[];let n=c.nextElementSibling;for(;n&&"P"===n.tagName;)t.push(n),n=n.nextElementSibling;const o=[c,...t];o.forEach(e=>{e.style.backgroundColor="#444"}),setTimeout(()=>{o.forEach(e=>{e.style.backgroundColor=""})},1500)}}else{const e=document.querySelector(".right-panel"+n);e&&(document.querySelectorAll(".right-panel").forEach(e=>e.style.display="none"),e.style.display="inline-block")}}}),document.addEventListener("copy",e=>{document.copyData&&(e.clipboardData.setData("text/plain",document.copyData),document.copyData="",e.preventDefault())});const copyInfoBtn=document.querySelector(".btn-copy-discord"),flashingButton=setInterval(()=>{copyInfoBtn.style.backgroundColor="red"===copyInfoBtn.style.backgroundColor?"":"red"},500);function populateTextInfo(e){e=JSON.parse(e)||[];const t=document.getElementById("welcome-text");e.forEach(e=>{const[n,o]=e;if("heading"===o){const e=document.createElement("h3");e.textContent=n,t.appendChild(e)}else{const e=document.createElement("p");e.innerHTML=n.replace(/(press and hold ".")/g,'<span class="highlight">$1</span>'),t.appendChild(e)}})}copyInfoBtn.addEventListener("click",()=>{document.copyData="https://discord.gg/grmzsZE4ua",document.execCommand("copy");const e=copyInfoBtn.innerHTML;copyInfoBtn.textContent="Copied!",clearInterval(flashingButton),copyInfoBtn.style.backgroundColor="",setTimeout(()=>{copyInfoBtn.innerHTML=e},2e3)}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",generateLeftNav)</script><script>document.addEventListener("wheel",function(e){const o=document.elementFromPoint(e.clientX,e.clientY);o&&o.closest(".panel")&&(o.closest(".panel").scrollTop+=e.deltaY,e.preventDefault())},{passive:!1});const wrapper=document.querySelector(".menu-wrapper"),header=document.querySelector(".menu-title"),closeButton=document.createElement("div");closeButton.className="close-button",closeButton.innerHTML="&times;",wrapper.appendChild(closeButton),closeButton.addEventListener("mousedown",function(){A3API.SendAlert("exit")});const pos={x1:0,y1:0,x2:0,y2:0},onMouseMove=e=>{e.preventDefault();const{clientX:o,clientY:t}=e;pos.x1=pos.x2-o,pos.y1=pos.y2-t,pos.x2=o,pos.y2=t,wrapper.style.top=wrapper.offsetTop-pos.y1+"px",wrapper.style.left=wrapper.offsetLeft-pos.x1+"px"},onMouseUp=()=>{document.removeEventListener("mouseup",onMouseUp),document.removeEventListener("mousemove",onMouseMove)},onMouseDown=e=>{e.preventDefault(),pos.x2=e.clientX,pos.y2=e.clientY,document.addEventListener("mouseup",onMouseUp),document.addEventListener("mousemove",onMouseMove)};header.addEventListener("mousedown",onMouseDown);const fpsDisplay=document.createElement("div");fpsDisplay.className="fps-display",document.body.appendChild(fpsDisplay);let frameTime=0,frameCount=0,lastLoop=performance.now();const fpsLoop=()=>{const e=performance.now();frameTime+=(e-lastLoop-frameTime)/20,lastLoop=e,frameCount++,requestAnimationFrame(fpsLoop)};setInterval(()=>{fpsDisplay.textContent=frameCount>60?`MENU FPS: ${(1e3/frameTime).toFixed(2)}`:"MENU FPS: -"},100),fpsLoop()</script><script>function atobr(o){const r=Uint8Array.from(atob(o),o=>o.charCodeAt(0));return new TextDecoder("utf-8").decode(r)}function btoar(o){const r=(new TextEncoder).encode(o),t=Array.from(r,o=>String.fromCharCode(o)).join("");return btoa(t)}</script></body></html>
